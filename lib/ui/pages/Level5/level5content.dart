          '''A poor woman who was good at fashion designing worked hard every day to take care of herself and her young son. She spent hours making beautiful clothes, hoping her hard work would help them live a better life. Finally, people started noticing her designs, and her shop began to get more orders. She felt happy and thought her struggles were finally paying off.
                            \nBut some of her friends became jealous of her success. One night, out of envy, they set her shop on fire. The fire destroyed everything she had worked for, and she was badly injured while trying to save her designs. She was rushed to the hospital, leaving her son worried and scared.
