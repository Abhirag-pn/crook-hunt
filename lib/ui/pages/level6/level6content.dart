          '''A 13-year-old boy started working to support his mother’s treatment and cover their daily needs. His mother, though deeply sad about her son’s condition, saw no other option. Even though he was so young, he was not treated kindly at the workplace.
                            
One day, after a long, tiring day at work, the boy came home and was both scared and angry at what he saw. His father, who had left them years ago, had returned. The boy knew that his father didn’t come with good intentions. He believed that his father only came back to take a part of his hard-earned money.
