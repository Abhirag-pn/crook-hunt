          '''Darwin was a person who cared only about money and luxury. He started by doing small jobs for money, but over time, he became a big drug dealer. One day, Darwin’s crime partner, Lena, asked him to meet her in the parking area.
  \nWhen Lena realized that Darwin and his drug business were the cause of her daughter’s death, she confronted him. She told him that drugs and money had blinded him, and if he continued this way, she would have no choice but to turn him in to the police. She said it was her responsibility to stop other mothers from going through the same pain.
